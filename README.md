# Acoustic Beam Visualization with k-Wave

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for simulating the generation, steering, and focusing of acoustic beams in a 2D water medium using the [k-Wave toolbox](http://www.k-wave.org/).

## 📁 Files Included

- `Focusing_commented.m`: Demonstrates focused acoustic wave propagation using phase delays.
- `source_delayed_commented.m`: Simulates a steered acoustic beam with custom delays across five sources.
- `source_delayed_3_commented.m`: A simplified 3-source variant of the delayed beam simulation.
- `wave_plane_commented.m`: Generates plane waves from multiple synchronized sources.

## 📘 Project Context

These simulations support a physical ripple tank experiment designed to visualize acoustic wavefronts. The goal is to bridge theoretical wave control techniques with real-world analogs using low-frequency sound and water as a medium.

## 📷 Applications

- Ultrasound beamforming
- Phased array demonstration
- Wave interference and focusing

## 🔧 Requirements

- MATLAB
- k-Wave Toolbox ([Download here](http://www.k-wave.org/download.php))
